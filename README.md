# 🐦 Bird vs. Forest Image Classifier 🌲

## ✨ Overview

Inspired by the 2015 XKCD comic that humorously highlighted the challenge of creating a computer system that could recognize birds 🎭, this project shows how modern deep learning techniques can accomplish this task in just minutes with free resources! ⚡

---

## 🚀 Features

🌐 Web Image Search: Uses DuckDuckGo Search API to automatically gather training images

🧠 Transfer Learning: Leverages a pre-trained neural network for efficient training

⚡ FastAI Integration: Utilizes the FastAI library for simplified deep learning workflows

🎯 Binary Classification: Distinguishes between "bird photos" and "forest photos"

📊 Interactive Results: See your model in action with real image predictions!

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

🐍 Python 3.7+

⚡ FastAI - For deep learning and transfer learning

🔍 DuckDuckGo Search API - For image collection

📓 Jupyter Notebook - For interactive development and experimentation

📦 Installation
📥 Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaJadhav17/bird-classifier-forest.git
cd is_it_a_bird
🔧 Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install fastai duckduckgo_search

```
---
## 🎯 Usage

The project is organized as a Jupyter notebook (is_it_a_bird.ipynb) that guides you through the entire process:

🖼️ Image Collection: Automatically searches and downloads bird and forest images

📂 Data Preparation: Organizes images into training and validation sets

🧠 Model Training: Fine-tunes a pre-trained ResNet model

✅ Model Evaluation: Tests the model on new images

🎉 Live Demo: Try your own images!

Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the results 🚀

## 🎓 Methodology

🔍 Data Collection: Uses DuckDuckGo to search for "bird photos" and "forest photos"

📊 Data Preparation: Downloads and organizes images into categories

🧠 Model Training: Employs transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN

✅ Validation: Tests the model on unseen images to evaluate performance

🎯 Prediction: Try your own images and see the magic! ✨

## 📈 Results

The model achieves 97.6% accuracy 🎯 in distinguishing between bird photos and forest scenes, demonstrating the power of transfer learning even with limited training data!

## 🎪 Applications

This approach can be adapted for various image classification tasks including:

🐦 Wildlife identification

🛡️ Content moderation

📦 Product categorization

🏥 Medical image analysis

🎮 Fun personal projects!

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

📷 Training data quality depends on search engine results

🐦 May require additional training for specific bird species

🎨 Performance varies with image quality and composition

🌐 Internet connection required for image collection

🚀 Future Enhancements
🎯 Expand to multi-class classification (different bird species 🦅🦉🦜)

🔄 Implement data augmentation techniques

🌐 Add web interface for real-time classification

📱 Deploy as a web service or mobile application

🎨 Add more categories (animals, landscapes, objects)
